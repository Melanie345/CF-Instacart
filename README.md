# Instacart Analysis
Python was used for this project, consistency checks and and wrangling steps performed, column derivations, analysis and visualizations. Population flow diagram and key questions answered in Excel.

## Objective
Uncover trends and sales patterns for an online grocery store. Perform an initial data and exploratory analysis to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

## Key Questions
* The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (ie. the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.
* They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.
* Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags.  Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
* Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.
* The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviours differ.  For example:
  * What's the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (ie. how often do they return to Instacart)?
  * Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customers's loyalty status?
  * Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer's region?
  * Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?
  * What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?
  * What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles? Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products customers are ordering.
 
## Data
The datasets used were:
* Customers
* Orders
* Orders_products_prior
* Products
* Departments

## Libraries
The data analysis and visualization were conducted using Jupyter notebooks in the Python environment, the libraries used:
* Pandas: for data analysis
* Numpy: for mathematical equations
* Seaborn: for data visualizations
* Matplotlib: for data visualizations
* Scipy: for mathematical equations

## Folders
The project folders are stored in the folder structure:
* 01 Project Management: Project Brief
* 02 Data: Original Data and Prepared Data (data files not uploaded to GitHub due to size limitations!)
* 03 Scripts: Jupyter notebooks containing coding for the analysis
* 04 Analysis: The visualizations used for developing insights are found here
* 05 Sent to Client: The final report presented in Excel

## Resources
Note: Instacart is a real company that has made their data available online. However, the contents of the attached project brief have been fabricated by Career Foundry for the purpose of this analysis.
